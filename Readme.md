The main objective of this project is to show the comparison between <i>Huber Loss </i> (for classification) and <i>Hinge Loss</i> with respect to robustness to outliers. We have added 0%, 15%, and 30% Noise to Training and Validation set of the data and then
checked the performance of our model. We have applied Linear SVM and SGD classifier model in this project. <br>
